# HTMveLocity

A hacky prototype of a Microsoft-Word-like (dubious) rapid prototyping tool for html.

Basic idea: you only need to support

1. selecting any element and make it contenteditable
2. creating a "blob" element that changes into any element
3. changing any element's attributes easily

to make a decent enough html editor.
